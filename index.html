        <h2>Why I Chose Film</h2>
        <p>I didn’t choose film.It speaks in light, in rhythm, in glances.
             I tell stories to echo,to feel,to remember.</p>

  <h2>Moments That Moved Me</h2>

    <h3>The Emotional Strings</h3>
    <p>The rollercoaster of emotions we get to journey on,in this stories,without setting foot outside
        the house .As someone of the introvert tribe, this hooked me,like spectacular you don't have to
        say anything else,immersing myself in this little moments in frames,that's all it took.</p>

   <p>Sometimes the loudest moment in a film is a single sound. Clean, simple, final. A door. A goodbye. A beginning.</p>

  <h2>My Voice as a Filmmaker</h2>
  <p>I dwell in moments not yet seen Frames adrift between the waking world and what we dare not name. With lens as lantern, I follow shadows where thought and silence meet. If you, too, have wandered the quiet corridors of the mind,you're awesome</p>

  <h2>A Dream She Keeps Returning To</h2>
  <p> 
    A woman wakes inside a house with no clocks. The windows are bricked, the mirrors veiled.  
    Each room feels like memory, but none of it is hers.  
    Outside, voices call her name, but they don’t use the right tone.  
    She moves from door to door, looking for the version of herself that can answer.  
    It’s not a nightmare. It’s Tuesday. </p>
